<article> My mother wouldn't take me to McDonalds one day so I shouted "When I get my license, I'm eating McDonalds EVERYDAY!" || What does it mean when your therapist proposes that he ghostwrite your story? || Oftentimes, I find myself in a situation where someone is saying to me "you are the first person I've heard this has actually happened to" and my take is this: There's no gold star for being a trail-blazer || I knew I had crossed the line when my mom started chasing me accross the yard weilding a rake, but that wasn't the time to get comfortable and have a chat, you know? || When you grow up religious you learn to make lemonade a lot, and you get really damn good at it too because there seems to be a lot of lemons in this life || When I first heard NPR talking about Africa, it was about a hunger crisis and I asked my father why we couldn't just feed them because we had so much food and he said that they weren't like us and that it was all just fine, and I really blame that interaction for a majority of my emotional failings || I was sure that I was adopted into my family from approximately age 5 to 22 || Sometimes, I hear myself and I just want to die of boredom || The hardest part of getting older is trying to remember how mature you believed someone that age was when you were 7 and hazard a guess at how an actor might approach the situation. </article>
