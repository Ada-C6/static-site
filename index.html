      <h2>Welcome to my site!</h2>
      <p>
        This website is part of a beginning CSS learning experience at <a href= "http://www.adadevelopersacademy.org">Ada Developers Academy</a>, where I am currently a student in Cohort 6. Please explore this site and send me feedback if you like. <br>
        I have included some of my current projects in the portfolio section of this site, and I plan on writing at least a few journal entries about Things That Happen At Ada.<br>
        This is going to be my "sandbox" website for a while, changing and updating as I get better at making web sites. Studying at Ada is an honor and a privilege, but it is also really, really hard and time-consuming, so we will see how much attention I can give this site.
