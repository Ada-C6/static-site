          <h2>On Applying to Ada</h2>
          <p>Applying to Ada Developers Academy can be a stressful--but fun and challenging--experience. When I applied, I had to go through three stages and 3 interviews before getting an acceptance email.</p>
          <p> When it comes to the application, I really have only one tip (it's the first one here). The last two are just things to think about when you're considering whether or not Ada is right for you. There's so much out there in terms of bootcamps, courses, programs, etc. that are very different from Ada (with regards to timeline, mission, and more). So consider those points as well while you're reflecting on your application or if you're trying to make a decision among all your options. </p>

          <h4>1. Spend as much time as you can on the application.</h4>

          <p>This is definitely not the time to rush through your application! Sure, the deadline might be fast approaching, but it's better to spend your time curating your answers to the best of your ability. </p>

          <p>If you're worried about applying to the first or second deadline, I would recommend just applying when it feels right. If you can get it in during the first wave, that's awesome! If not, don't fret.</p>

          <p> In any case, I definitely recommend not waiting until the very last minute to submit your app. Things can--and might--go wrong. When I applied, I tried to submit my application 12 hours before the first deadline. That is, until Github throught I "wasn't a human" and all my links to my answers were broken. Fortunately everything got fixed before the 7pm deadline, but it was also good to know that this wasn't my last chance to submit the application.</p>

          <h4>2. Be ready for one heck of a year.</h4>
          <p>Ada is pretty much all code and all feelings all day every day. Really.</p>
          <p>The curriculum is fast-paced and intense, and you'll be in a classroom with windows facing a serious-looking boardroom from 9AM to 5PM (not counting tutoring hours if you decide to go). Translation: lots of screen time and information you'll absorb all day. It can become way too much sometimes, to the point where your brain feels like it has exploded. Like 5 times. In 5 minutes.</p>
          <p>Which is totally ok. There will be days where code is hard. As Kari (our instructor) likes to remind us "You are not your code." That's important to remember.</p>
          <p>You'll also be hanging out with at least 24-48 people every day, all day. Even though I love my classmates, I'm also an introvert that gets drained by constant communication every day.</p>
          <p>That said, you get like 48+ people who are supportive and rooting for you day in and day out. So that's awesome. It's all very emotional, but 90% in a good way. Just prepare yourself for that.</p>

          <h4>3. Really relfect on Ada's Mission Statement.</h4>
          <p>If you're unsure whether or not you're "the right fit" for Ada (or really, if Ada is fit for you!), read and reflect on the mission statmement.</p>
          <p>To be honest, the mission statement was a big guiding point for me when I applied to Ada. As someone who holds multiple identities (queer, POC, genderqueer, all-around dork, etc.), I was drawn mainly to the fact that Ada was intentionally inclusive in their mission statement. It sounded like a good place for me, a place that could affirm my identity in an intense learning environment.</p>
          <p>But it's a two-way street. The mission statement was also important to me to know how I would work and learn with an extremely diverse group of amazing people. Was I ready to work with people from various coding backgrounds, ages, genders, and more? And with Ada's social justice curriculum, was I prepared for the hard discussions, for learning and growing alongside peers who are trying their best to learn about their own biases and respect others in the room?</p>
          <p>If that sounds like something you're ready for or interested in, Ada's a great place. But I wouldn't recommend it for someone who's looking for just a coding class, or someone who wants a more streamlined learning experience. Ada is a huge commitment that encompasses so much more than code, which makes it a unqiue program. </p>
