          <h2>On Applying to Ada</h2>
          <p>Applying to Ada Developers Academy can be a stressful experience. When I applied, I had to go through three stages and 3 interviews before getting an acceptance email. Here are a few of my tips.</p>

          <h4>1. Spend as much time as you can on the application.</h4>
          <p>This is definitely not the time to rush through your application! Sure, the deadline might be fast approaching, but it's better to spend your time curating your answers to the best of your ability. </p>
          <p>If you're worried about applying to the first or second deadline, I would recommend just applying when it feels right. If your goal was to get it through before the first deadline, but you feel like you didn't really answer the questions to the best of your ability, it's totally cool to wait for the second deadline! </p>

          <h4>2. Be ready for one heck of a year.</h4>
          <p>Ada is pretty much all code and all feelings all day every day. Really.</p>
          <p>The curriculum is fast-paced and intense, and you'll be in a classroom with windows facing a serious-looking boardroom from 9AM to 5PM (not counting tutoring hours if you decide to go).</p>
          <p>You'll also be hanging out with at least 24-48 people every day, all day. Even though I love my classmates, I'm also an introvert that gets drained by constant communication every day.</p>
          <p>That said, you get like 48+ people who are supportive and rooting for you day in and day out. So that's awesome. It's all very emotional, but 90% in a good way.</p>

          <h4>3. Really relfect on Ada's Mission Statement.</h4>
          <p>If you're unsure whether or not you're "the right fit" for Ada (or really, if Ada is fit for you!), read and reflect on the mission statmement.</p>
          <p>To be honest, the mission statement was a big guiding point for me when I applied to Ada. As someone who holds multiple identities (queer, POC, genderqueer, all-around dork, etc.), I was drawn mainly to the fact that Ada was intentionally inclusive in their mission statement. It sounded like a good place for me, a place that could affirm my identity in an intense learning environment.</p>
          <p>But it wasn't just whether or not I would fit in. The mission statement was also important to me to know how I would work and learn with an extremely diverse group of amazing people. Was I ready to work with people from various coding backgrounds, ages, genders, and more? And with Ada's social justice curriculum, was I prepared for the hard discussions, for learning and growing alongside peers who are trying their best to learn about their own biases and respect others in the room?</p>
          <p>If that sounds like something you're ready for, Ada's a great place. But I wouldn't recommend it for someone who's looking for just a coding class, or someone who wants a more streamlined learning experience.</p>
