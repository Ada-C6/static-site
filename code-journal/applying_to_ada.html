          <h2>On Applying to Ada</h2>
          <p>Applying to Ada Developers Academy can be a stressful experience. When I applied, I had to go through three stages and 3 interviews before getting an acceptance email. Here are a few of my tips.</p>

          <h4>2. Be ready for one heck of a year.</h4>
          <p>Ada is pretty much all code and all feelings all day every day. Really.</p>
          <p>The curriculum is fast-paced and intense, and you'll be in a classroom with windows facing a serious-looking boardroom from 9AM to 5PM (not counting tutoring hours if you decide to go).</p>
          <p>You'll also be hanging out with at least 24-48 people every day, all day. Even though I love my classmates, I'm also an introvert that gets drained by constant communication every day.</p>
          <p>That said, you get like 48+ people who are supportive and rooting for you day in and day out. So that's awesome. It's all very emotional, but 90% in a good way.</p>

          <h4>3.Really relfect on Ada's Mission Statement</h4>
          <p>If you're unsure whether or not you're "the right fit" for Ada (or really, if Ada is fit for you!), read and reflect on the mission statmement.</p>
          <p>To be honest, the mission statement was a big guiding point for me when I applied to Ada. As someone who holds multiple identities (queer, POC, genderqueer, all-around dork, etc.), I was drawn mainly to the fact that Ada was intentionally inclusive in their mission statement. It sounded like a good place for me, a place that could affirm my identity in an intense learning environment.</p>
          <p>But it wasn't just whether or not I would fit in. The mission statement was also important to me to know how I would work and learn with an extremely diverse group of amazing people. Was I ready to work with people from various coding backgrounds, ages, genders, and more? And with Ada's social justice curriculum, was I prepared for the hard discussions, for learning and growing alongside peers who are trying their best to learn about their own biases and respect others in the room?</p>
          <p>If that sounds like something you're ready for, Ada's a great place. But I wouldn't recommend it for someone who's looking for just a coding class, or someone who wants a more streamlined learning experience.</p>
