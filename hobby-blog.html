          Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen.

          Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? Very easy to work these to death. This is unplanned it really just happens. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper.

          The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. We'll do another happy little painting. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart.

        <p>
          We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. Put it in, leave it alone. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down.
