            <p>WOO HOO! I was working from my home office when I checked my gmail account and discovered Ada had sent an acceptance email a few hours earlier. I was literally jumping for joy... for a number of minutes! I wish someone had been present to watch. I called Sean at work and possibly left the most squealing, excited voice message ever. He had a difficult time understanding me and called me right back because he wanted to make sure I was okay. ;) </p>
