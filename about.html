        Hello! My name is Noelle Morris, and I am currently learning
        full-stack web development at
        <a href="http://www.adadevelopersacademy.org">Ada Developers
        Academy</a>, and am a member of Cohort 6. I have been learning
        Ruby and HTML/CSS, and will soon begin learning Rails and
        JavaScript. I have also completed <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-programming-nanodegree--nd000">
        Udacity&lsquo;s Intro to Programming Nanodegree</a>, which
        focuses on Python, HTML/CSS, and some JavaScript. I am not
        sure which programming language I like best&mdash;each has
        its own challenges. I am enjoying each new challenge that
        comes my way!
      </p>
      <p>
        Before entering software, I wanted to work in archaeology,
        linguistics, or cultural anthropology. To that end, I
        earned a Bachelor of Arts in Anthropology (with a minor in
        Linguistics) from the University of Nevada, Reno. During the
        summer of 2012, I interned with the US Forest Service, doing
        archaeological survey work and excavation in Klamath National
        Forest in northern California.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my spare time, I love reading, camping, hiking, backpacking,
        reading, cooking, and eating. Recently, I have gotten into
        sea kayaking.
