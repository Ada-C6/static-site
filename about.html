        <p>
          I am currently in the process of becoming a software engineer by attending <a href="http://www.adadevelopersacademy.org">Ada Developers Academy</a>, a full-time software development school in Seattle for female-identified people. Ada aims to change the gender dynamics of the industry by offering its students a career change into the tech field, and I am very excited about this opportunity! In my previous career, I was a self-employed musician, so coding is something very new and exciting. It is fun and satisfying in a completely different way from playing music. <br>
          When I'm not busy with Ada, I spend time reading, going to concerts and the opera, playing piano for fun, dancing, walking through nature, and cooking and baking with my family.
