        I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. Don't fiddle with it all day.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. A happy cloud. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. This piece of canvas is your world. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Maybe there's a little something happening right here.

        In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. Let all these things just sort of happen. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. Put it in, leave it alone. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light.
