          I am currently in the process of becoming a software engineer by attending <a href="http://www.adadevelopersacademy.org">Ada Developers Academy</a>, a full-time software development school in Seattle for female-identified people. Ada aims to change the gender dynamics of the industry by offering its students a career change into the tech field, and I am very excited about this opportunity.

          In my previous career, I was a classical pianist, so coding is something very new and different. I am looking forward to entering the industry when I have completed my program in July 2017.

          When I'm not busy studying, I spend time reading, going to concerts and the opera, playing piano for fun, dancing, walking through nature, and cooking and baking with my family.
