      <h4>A little about me...</h4>
      <p>I grew up in <a href="http://www.townofmonument.org/">Monument, Colorado</a>, a place that probably started as a truck stop between Colorado Springs and Denver, but has since grown into its own moderately-sized town (because it now has a Chili's.)</p>
      <p>As a child, I knew I was going to become an actress and a writer. But, as we know, kids are dumb, and I really had no idea what kind of work had to go into that sort of lifestyle. I lasted a whole semester in film school at the <a href="http://www.ucdenver.edu/pages/ucdwelcomepage.aspx">University of Colorado Denver</a> before wimping out and moving into a safer major: sociology. Little did I know that, in the end, those two degrees would be equally useless to me as a person.</p>
      <p>Instead, I found some adequate filler careers in higher education until finally deciding a great compromise between my technical side and my creative side would be working in computer programming. I was lucky enough to be accepted into <a href="http://adadevelopersacademy.org/">Ada Developer's Academy</a>, without which this website would not exist because it's a homework assignment.</p>
      <p>So feel free to revisit this site and follow my journey into the tech world. I hear there are a lot of free t-shirts.</p>
