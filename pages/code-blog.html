      <h2>But Then There's Whedon Ipsum</h2>
      <p>
        I don't buckle. Occasionally I swashbuckle. I've seen the best and the worst of you. Last month he's the freak with jicama breath who waxes his back. No, they're something nightmares are from. Wash, we've got some local color happening. Can everybody just notice how much fire I'm not on? And now the one person who should be here is gone, and a waste like you gets to live. When I say, 'I love you,' it's not because I want you or because I can't have you. Uh, hey, I got a idea. Instead of us hanging around playing art critic 'til I get pinched by the man, how's about we move away from this eerie-ass piece of work, and get on with our increasingly eerie-ass day. How's that? I dislike that Anya. She's newly human and strangely literal.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you say 'adorabubble,' I'm leaving. So I skipped intro to evil or whatever, but how is it that I get an F, when this guy that we're reading, Chauncey, can't even spell? My Uncle Rory was the stodgiest taxidermist you've ever met by day. Hey, no, we'll just set course for Planet of the Lonely, Rich, and Appropriately Hygienic Man. You are talking crazy-person talk. Put your words in word places please. Magic's all balderdash and chicanery. Spike! It's Spike. And he's wearing a coat. Recognizing someone else's power does not diminish your own.

      <h2>Also Important: Lorem Metaphorpsum</h2>
      <p>
        Georgic bases show us how curves can be australias. The literature would have us believe that a kayoed milkshake is not but a panther. Northward bladders show us how frances can be noses.
      </p>
      <p>
        The heirless science reveals itself as a tattered noodle to those who look. In recent years, their kohlrabi was, in this moment, a mantic call. One cannot separate snowstorms from counter seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their list was, in this moment, a campy eagle. What we don't know for sure is whether or not the peripheral of a dashboard becomes a flameproof sphynx. The literature would have us believe that a gateless stepdaughter is not but a column.
      </p>
      <p>
        Boxes are pokey ferries. The tailless joke comes from an unshamed architecture. A criminal is a hubcap's wine.
