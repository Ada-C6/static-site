            <strong>OBJECTIVES:</strong> Model a farmer’s market database of markets, vendors, products, and sales. Use Test Driven Development, work with raw data (csv), organizing/working with multiple files, practice using enumerables.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>OBSERVATIONS:</strong> At the beginning of the week, I was really open to talking through things with my classmates even if I hadn’t started working on the requirement they wanted to talk about, since I’d then have a better idea of the strategy I wanted to use when I got there. But as the week went on, I started to get nervous as I hadn’t completed as much as I would have liked to, so I cut back on my conversations so that I could focus on my own work. I also observed my tests taking a long time to run, so I talked with a friend about memoization in order to only have to read the data file once.

            <strong>OBJECTIVES:</strong> Model the setup of a Scrabble game (tiles, scoring rules, player). Work in a pair, trading off driver/navigator roles, using Test Driven Development. Create class and instance methods, using single responsibility principle, add complexity/refactor with each wave.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>OBSERVATIONS:</strong> My partner on this project was ill for several days, so while I didn’t get to practice in-person pair programming, we were able to practice division of work (I would carve out individual portions of work for her to do when she was able). I also chatted with other classmates to come up with/document a strategy for tackling the requirements, and wrote copious comments. I really enjoyed the TDD, writing the code after writing the tests was relatively straightforward as I knew what I was expecting out of each function.

          <p>
            <strong>OBJECTIVES:</strong> Understand and use Class inheritance with a Bank Account Superclass and Checking/Savings subclasses. Create and use class methods, access a CSV to create instances of classes, practice using git commands.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>OBSERVATIONS:</strong> During this project, I really felt the desire for automated tests! I wanted to use a class variable for a minimum balance, but noticed that class variables in subclasses can overwrite one defined in the superclass, so ended up needing to use a constant instead. Enjoyed getting a SavingsAccount subclass with only those responsibilities that it needed, inheriting everything else from the BankAccount  superclass.
