        <section>
          <h5>Photography</h5>
          <p>I, like every second person and their mom who at one point had enough money to buy a dSLR camera, have dabbled in photography. Please visit my separate <a href="photography-pages/photography.html">photography portfolio</a> for more.

        <section>
          <h5>Calligraphy</h5>
          <p>Back when I worked at <a href="http://www.reed.edu">Reed College</a>, I was lucky enough to be able to participate in their <a href="http://www.reed.edu/gallery/Calligraphy_Initiative.html">Calligraphy Initiative</a>, a free weekly class we lovingly called "Scriptorium" that taught the basics of calligraphy, from Roman Capitals to Uncials to Italics and all sorts of hand cramps in between.</p>
          <p>Some samples of my calligraphy can be seen <a href="calligraphy.html">here</a>.
        </section>

        <section>
          <h5>Writing</h5>
          <p>Just in case code-writing wasn't enough, I also love fiction writing, both prose and screenplays. If you happen to be a super-competent writing agent who somehow found your way here, first off -- wow, welcome to the depths of the internet but secondly -- I have a completed first novel in a series that I <em>just know</em> (because you're imaginary) is right up your alley and will make us millions of dollars. Please <a href="mailto:nicole.url.4@gmail.com">email me</a> for more information.</p>
