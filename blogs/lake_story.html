    This weekend my sister and I wanted to go bird watching. We were in the Olympics and staying on a beautiful farm on top of a hill. My sister was still on Chicago time and woke up at 6am. I was awake before her mostly because she had a cold and snored very loudly around 4am. She was enthusiastic to see the birds and I got up red-eyed and dazed. "Do I tell her how loud she was or let it go?", I wondered. After telling her that her snoring was out of control, we go in the car and went to a highly recommended spot for bird watching. There we found a jogger that looked like Long-John Silver, a man living in his car and a paper factory. Disappointed, I told her of a lovely lake a classmate had mentioned in a lighting talk. It was only a half hour away and I was wide awake by then. The downers were, that: 1. It was raining and 2. This seemed to be the only place in Washington state where cars drove fast. Except it wasn't only cars but huge trucks with logs. These trucks were especially scary because of the horror movie, "The Descent" where the main character's family was killed by such a truck. Anyway, in the end we did not die. We eneded up at a beautiful lake only 40 miles away from Forks; the hometown of Bella Swan.
