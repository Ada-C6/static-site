        Presidents' Day 2016. Entering an unassuming office space above a local flower shop, laptop fully set up for my latest developer <a href="http://ric.mclaughlin.today/projects/github-pages-portfolio-session1">class</a>, I couldn't wait to start working on my portfolio website and blog. The timing couldn't have been better--I was <span class="italic-content">finally</span> ready!
      </p>
      <p>
        An explanation would be good here, I think.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since starting my coding journey a year and a half ago, I've heard numerous times how helpful it can be to blog what you're working on and experiencing.
      </p>
      <div class="italic-content break">
        "There's always someone earlier in their coding journey who'd learn something from it!"
      </div>
      <div class="italic-content break">
        "It'll be like a notebook of what you know that you can refer to later on!"
      </div>
      <p>
        But I stayed skeptical about these sentiments being true for <span class="italic-content">me</span>. Or, more accurately, continued to fly a Nope! Nope! Nope! jet pack waaaaaaay off into the distance. Publishing newbish coding experiences and silly mistakes via questionable blogging skills: <span class="bold-content">so</span> much worse than putting bad poetry online back when I was in my teens. Yay modern digital permanence!
      </p>
      <p>
        Not to mention doom scenarios of internet trolls telling me exactly how much I suck completely outweighing the more likely outcomes. (I come from a MMO gaming background--I've learned that playing with randoms can be gnarly.)
      </p>
      <p>
        But over time, the reasonable scenarios started fighting for room inside my head. Perhaps only loyal friends and family I <strike>begged</strike> <strike>bribed</strike> persuaded into coming would read this. Or maybe the occasional "Hey, this was helpful for me. Thanks for sharing!" optimistic outcome really <span class="italic-content">could</span> happen.
      </p>
      <p>
        That last one's surfaced more and more these past few months, which is why I started jotting down blog post ideas and considering what kind of platform to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just by being here, I think I've replaced that old jet pack with a new one and a new destination. I guess time will tell who I could see along the way and when, so I'll just say this in advance.
      </p>
