        (The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Geek-Girls-Carrots/events/219096387/">Code Carrots Workshop</a> had a format of 6 weekly meetings, each lasting 2-3 hours, concluding with a project demonstration day.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Member of the workshop's Praise Reminder team (4 participants, 1 mentor) that created "revIver"â€”a web app that randomly selects praise previously entered and saved by logged in users.
      </p>
      <p>
        Summary of contributions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>I brought the idea to the workshop, whiteboarding my initial thoughts about the project to my group. Documented additional team-generated project scope (features and stretch goals, programming languages to use, etc.)</li>

        <li>Worked mostly on our CSS file and HTML files for the index, adding praise, editing praise, and deleting praise pages; pair programmed with one other team member both at weekly sessions and via <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">JSFiddle</a>; <div>received input from back end focused team members on formatting choices and implemented suggestions.</div></li>

        <li>Worked on some basic Python to learn about Django templates and linking front end files to back end infrastructure.</li>

        <li>Used my prior project management experience in ensuring group communications were clear and up to date, secured a URL for the project for future use, and prepared the presentation slides for Demo Day.</li>

        <li>I kicked off the Demo Day presentation by discussing the whiteboarding process plus some aspects of the front end. Other members of our team discussed their project contributions, then we finished up with our project team's takeaways.</li>
