      <h3>Priority Management while at Ada</h3>

          Being in a coding boot camp is hard. Ada is by all accounts a far more supportive boot camp than many others, and I love being here. But in order to be successful, I have to make sure I have all my priorities in order. My current priorities are:
          <ul>
            <li>Sleep</li>
            <li>My kid</li>
            <li>Ada</li>
            <li>Partner and family</li>
          </ul>
          This is pretty much the current established order, although the ordering is not quite as neatly linear as it might seem at first glance.<br>
          For instance, sleep affects everything. It affects my ability to study; it affects my ability to function at daily tasks, and it affects my mood when my kid requires patience, or when my boyfriend is having a bad day. It affects my physical capabilities as well - being able to run around the playground, or go exercise. I have struggled with stress-induced insomnia for years, and I am finally getting a handle on it. If it is between finishing a project and sleep, I will most definitely sleep first and worry about the project later. If it is between caring for my kid and sleep, things become fuzzier - I will of course calm him through a nightmare, or be there when he is sick, and make sure he knows I am there for him. But we have ongoing age appropriate conversations about being quiet on weekend mornings so Mama can sleep in, about asking for water, story, song, and night light before the official good night, and similar things. But I can say with confidence that taking care of my sleep positively affects all other areas of my life.<br>
          My kid is more important than Ada. If something happened to him, I'd drop everything and be there. That's just a fact of life. However, I am also at Ada because I want to be able to provide for him, because I want to be in a job wth flexible hours and reliable pay and benefits, so, again, the priorities get fuzzy. It's a balancing act in the evening: do I play with him, or do I send him to play by himself so I do my homework? Often, I choose the former. There's time for homework after bedtime. And I attend events on evenings he is with his father.<br>
          Partner, friends and family: again, it gets fuzzy. If there were a major change in circumstances affecting the health of my parents, my sister, or my boyfriend: That would be very hard, and I would have to see how I adjust my priorities. But as it stands currently, none of those people get any input about my current life choices regarding Ada, and I expect them to not only respect my homework responsibilities, but also help me succeed in significant ways. My boyfriend takes care of my kid post-school, my friends babysit him when I attend evening events, and I reciprocate whenever my schedule allows.<br>
          We have a classroom policy at Ada: you have responsibility toward yourself, toward your classmates (I extend this towards my family), and toward the community as a whole. It's tricky, but remembering how everything is interconnected and affects everything else really helps make good choices. It is not "sleep or Ada"; it is "sleep so that Ada".
