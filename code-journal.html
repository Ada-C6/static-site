      <h2>First Break From Ada: Short Reflections</h2>
      <p><b>Posted on: </b> September 27, 2016</p>
      <p><b>Currently drinking:</b> Scuttlebutt Brewing Company’s KEXP Transistor IPA</p>

      <p>We’ve finally come to our first week-long break from Ada, and I gotta say, it’s been a much-needed break!</p>
      <p>I’ve learned a lot in the last six weeks, like how to use git commands in the Terminal, to what exactly is the Terminal. Before getting to the break, we spent a week on HTML/CSS, but only scratching the surface enough to build the static website that you’re now reading this blog post from (cool, right?). There has also been a lot of Ruby since day 1 and we’re moving on to Ruby on Rails when we get back.</p>

      <p>Honestly, I don’t want to spell out everything we’ve learned, but if you’re interested, you can check out Ada’s curriculum on Github to get a sense of all the topics we’ve covered.</p>

      <p>Overall, it’s been a great learning experience. It’s been cool to look back and see all the projects we’ve worked on, from building a random menu generator using simple arrays and hashes, to the complicated nature of a relational database with thousands of data rows in CSV files. It’s amazing to think that we’ve covered so much in so little time, even though it can sometimes feel like I’ve little so little or need to learn so much more. A part of me feels like I should take advantage of the break and review more Ruby or get a better grip on CSS/HTML, but I would say 90% of me just thinks I haven’t had enough beer during this break and I should fix that before it’s over.</p>
      <p>In sum, my brain is pretty fried and I am definitely glad to have a week of less code and computer time. I’ve been spending my break on Orcas Island with Iris (the best partner in the world) and her family, and it’s been relatively relaxing.
      Tomorrow we leave on a late-night boat to head back to Seattle (with our cat Foot Foot in tow), and then we’ll get to meet up with our friend, Ariela, who is coming up from Portland. Hurray! So before we leave, I plan on making a visit to the local brewery to drink a few pints with my current read.</p>
      <p>Maybe I’ll write more feelings about code, but more likely I will write feelings about beer. Until next time!</p>
