            Happy Birthday to my niece Ada! I’m not sure whether she knows that 1: I’m going to a school that is the same as her name, and 2: she’s named for a really awesome lady in computer science history. She might be old enough now to understand though, so I’ll report back on her reaction.

            I’ve been making a series of party-sea-animal stamps (started out with an octopus), and at some point decided that I needed a party hat. It’s pretty awesome to make your own stamps, and the process has taught me to not get too caught up in how good my drawing looks.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m getting better at drawing the more I do it - practice practice practice. But the process of making a stamp has so many layers of interpretation (drawing, tracing, transferring to stamp surface, carving, stamping), that what you end up with is so different than what you start with. And it’s okay if your drawing isn’t exactly the way you want it, because that’s not what your stamp will end up looking like!

            A few weeks ago, and Adie Alum (Marleigh) came to talk to us, and gave an awesome motivational talk. Ada is challenging. And intense. And fun. And tiring.
          </p>
          <p>
            She had us write down the people we admired, the reasons why we joined Ada, and the things we do (outside of coding) that we enjoy/help us relieve stress, and told us to keep this piece of paper for when we’re having a tough time. It’s to remind us of the importance of continuing to do the things that make us us, so that we don’t lose our way during this exciting but exhausting time.

            Today I’m remembering the weekend I went biking around San Juan Island, the lavender field, and the happy bumble bees buzzing away as they went about their pollination duties.
